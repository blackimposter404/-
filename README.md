Minesweeper: How to Play and Tips to Win
Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that challenges your logic and deduction skills. The goal is to clear a grid without detonating any hidden mines. It‚Äôs simple to learn but difficult to master!
How to Play Minesweeper
The Grid
The game is played on a rectangular grid (usually Beginner: 9√ó9, Intermediate: 16√ó16, Expert: 30√ó16).
Some squares contain hidden mines, while others are safe.
Left-Click to Reveal a Square
Clicking a square reveals what‚Äôs underneath:
A number (1‚Äì8): Shows how many mines are adjacent to that square.
An empty space: No mines nearby; adjacent squares will automatically open.
A mine: You lose!
Right-Click to Flag Mines
If you suspect a mine, right-click to place a flag (üö©).
Right-click again to mark with a question mark (‚ùì) if unsure.
Win Condition
You win when all non-mine squares are revealed.
Tips for Success
Start with corners or edges ‚Äì They have fewer adjacent squares.
Use numbers to deduce mines ‚Äì If a square says "1," only one adjacent square is a mine.
Look for patterns ‚Äì For example, a "1-2-1" pattern along a wall means mines are next to the "2."
Guess wisely ‚Äì Sometimes, you must take a 50/50 chance.
Minesweeper is a great way to improve logical thinking. Give it a try‚Äîjust don‚Äôt hit a mine on your first move! üòâ
